# Deviantart-Ad-Blocker
This script is designed to aid an adblocker in completely removing devaintart's new anti-adblocker ads.

This scrip is made for Tampermonkey, I'm uncertain if Greasemonkey follows the same format. If it does then it should work there too.

##How to Use
### Adblock Filter
In Ublock origin add `! 6/14/2016, 6:33:56 PM deviantart.com
||st.deviantart.net/roses/jsmin/pages/browse.js$script,domain=deviantart.com/art/*` to the custom filter list. Change the date to your current date if you want. You may also be able to use this in other adblockers. Check to see what format your adblocker uses and see if you can use it or adjust it to work in your adblocker.

##Tampermonkey script
Once you have Tampermonkey installed in chrome click this link: https://github.com/Sunlitazure/Deviantart-Ad-Blocker/raw/nowmaster/daAdBlocker.user.js

a Tampemonkey page should pop up with an install button. Click install.

Congrats, you should now be able to browse Deviantart annoyance free!
